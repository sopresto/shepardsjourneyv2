                in an unfamiliar place. She and his sheep are now miles away from home and time is running out! The sun will
                soon set and unleash the horrific creatures that lurk the night. You must get back to your farm in once piece
                with as many sheep as possible. Do this before sunset or else NOBODY will make it backâ€¦.</p>
